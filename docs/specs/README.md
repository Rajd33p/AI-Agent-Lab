## High-Level Spec for Developing an AI Agent with LangChain and OpenAI

This spec is a good starting point for developing an AI Agent with LangChain and OpenAI on the AI Agent Host. The spec provides clear and concise instructions for how to develop an AI Agent, and it takes into account the features of the AI Agent Host.


### 1. Define a Clear and Standardized API Specification
To enable seamless communication between the AI Agent on the microserver and the [AI application](https://github.com/quantiota/AI-Agent-Farm/tree/master/doc/ai-application) on the GPU server, define a clear and standardized API specification. This specification should outline the following:

- Endpoints: List all the endpoints that the AI Agent should use to interact with the AI application, including the specific methods (GET, POST, etc.) allowed for each endpoint.

- Request Formats: Specify the expected format of the requests that the AI Agent should send to the AI application, including any required parameters or headers.

- Response Formats: Describe the expected format of the responses that the AI Agent will receive from the AI application, including the necessary data fields and status codes.

- Authentication: Define the authentication mechanism for the API, such as API keys or tokens, to ensure secure communication between the AI Agent and the AI application.

By having a well-defined API specification, both the AI Agent and the AI application developers can work independently, knowing how their components should interact. The API documentation should be made available to the relevant teams, ensuring smooth integration and development within the distributed AI infrastructure.





### 2. Create a Dockerfile that defines the AI Agent container.

The Dockerfile should define the following:

- The base image for the AI Agent container.
- The dependencies that need to be installed in the AI Agent container.
- The configuration files that need to be copied into the AI Agent container.
- The working directory for the AI Agent within the container.
- Commands or entry points to start the AI Agent when the container is run.
- The source code for the AI Agent, which should be copied into the container.

### 3. Install the LangChain framework in the AI Agent container.

The LangChain framework, a Python library used for building AI agents, should be installed with the following considerations:

- The specific version of the LangChain library should be pinned for consistency.
- All additional dependencies that LangChain requires should also be installed.

### 4. Configure the AI Agent to interact with QuestDB, VSCode, and Grafana.

The AI Agent should be configured to interact with these tools as follows:

- QuestDB: Interact with QuestDB using either the PostgreSQL wire protocol or REST API to store and query data.    These methods allow for SQL INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT operations.
- Grafana: Interact with Grafana using the Grafana REST API to create and manage dashboards.
- VSCode: Interact with VSCode using the VSCode API to edit, run, and debug code.

Ensure that:

- Credentials for these services are securely stored and accessed, potentially using Docker Secrets.
- Proper network connectivity exists between the AI Agent and these services, possibly involving Docker network configuration or firewall rules adjustment.

### 5. Configure the AI Agent to access OpenAI's API.

The AI Agent should access OpenAI's API, which provides access to a number of language models such as GPT-3. Remember to:

- Securely store the OpenAI API key, potentially using Docker Secrets or environment variables.
- Implement error handling for potential issues with the API, such as rate limits or network problems.

### 6. Build and deploy the AI Agent container.

Once the AI Agent container has been built, it can be deployed to a Docker registry. The container can then be run on a variety of platforms, including cloud providers and on-premises servers. During this process:

- Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated building and deployment.
- If deploying to a cloud provider, ensure the necessary cloud resources and permissions are correctly configured.
- Set up logging and performance monitoring for the AI Agent.



### 7. Develop a User Interface for Interaction
Design and implement a user interface (UI) for user interaction with the AI Agent. The UI should:

- Provide a prompt or input field where users can ask questions or provide commands to the AI Agent.
- Display the responses generated by the AI Agent clearly and promptly.
- Handle errors gracefully, informing the user if something goes wrong.
- If needed, include a mechanism to get feedback from users about the AI Agent's responses for continuous improvement.
- Depending on your application, the UI could be a web interface, a command-line tool, a chatbot window, or another appropriate format.

Remember to consider usability and accessibility in your UI design to ensure a good user experience.

Also, the UI would need to interact with the Dockerized AI Agent service. This might involve setting up appropriate networking, APIs, or other interaction mechanisms. You might need to include another service in your Docker Compose setup specifically for serving the UI, if it's a web-based UI for example.




### 8 Update the AI Agent Host docker-compose.yaml file

Once the Docker images are built and pushed to a Docker registry, they can be added as  services to a Docker Compose file for a more complex deployment involving other services (such as QuestDB, Grafana, and VSCode). Proper network connectivity, volumes, and environment variables should be set in the Docker Compose file to ensure seamless interaction between the services. Securely manage all sensitive data like API keys and user credentials.

```
services:
  ...
  ai-agent:
    image: yourdockerregistry/ai-agent:tag
    environment:
      - LANGCHAIN_FRAMEWORK_CONFIG=/path/to/your/config
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=yourOpenAIKey
      - QUESTDB_PG_USER=admin
      - QUESTDB_PG_PASSWORD=quest
      - GRAFANA_API_KEY=yourGrafanaAPIKey
      - VSCODE_API_KEY=yourVSCodeAPIKey
    depends_on:
      - questdb
      - grafana
      - vscode
  ai-agent-ui:
    image: yourdockerregistry/ai-agent-ui:tag
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - ai-agent
```

You need to replace yourdockerregistry/ai-agent:tag with the name of your Docker image in the Docker registry. The depends_on field is used to define dependencies of your AI Agent. Here, I've assumed that your AI Agent depends on QuestDB, Grafana, and VSCode services.

Please note that you need to provide the configuration for LangChain, OpenAI API key, and API keys or user credentials for QuestDB, Grafana, and VSCode services. The specifics would depend on the exact implementation of your AI Agent and how it interacts with these services.

It's recommended to not hard-code sensitive data like API keys directly in the Docker Compose file. Docker supports secrets which is a safer method to handle sensitive data. Alternatively, you could use environment variables stored in a separate, unversioned file. For production environments, consider using more robust solutions like Vault by HashiCorp.

Also, remember to appropriately configure the networking and volumes if your AI Agent needs to communicate with other services or needs access to certain directories in the filesystem.


### 9 Difference Between `ai-agent` and `ai-agent-ui` Services

#### 1. **`ai-agent` Service**
- **Purpose**: This service likely runs the backend or core functionality of the AI agent. It handles the processing, data retrieval, or any AI-related operations.
- **Image**: `yourdockerregistry/ai-agent:tag` – Contains the main application logic for the AI agent.
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `LANGCHAIN_FRAMEWORK_CONFIG`: Path to the configuration file for the LangChain framework.
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for accessing OpenAI services.
  - `QUESTDB_PG_USER`: User for accessing the QuestDB database.
  - `QUESTDB_PG_PASSWORD`: Password for accessing the QuestDB database.
  - `GRAFANA_API_KEY`: API key for interacting with the Grafana API.
  - `VSCODE_API_KEY`: API key for interacting with the VS Code server.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `questdb`: Depends on the QuestDB service for database operations.
  - `grafana`: Depends on the Grafana service, possibly for monitoring or visualization purposes.
  - `vscode`: Depends on the VS Code service, possibly for code interaction or debugging features.

#### 2. **`ai-agent-ui` Service**
- **Purpose**: This service likely runs the frontend or user interface (UI) for interacting with the AI agent. It provides a web-based interface for user interaction.
- **Image**: `yourdockerregistry/ai-agent-ui:tag` – Contains the UI components or the web application that interfaces with the AI agent.
- **Ports**: 
  - Exposes port `5000` on the host, making the UI accessible via this port.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `ai-agent`: Depends on the `ai-agent` service, ensuring that the backend is available before the UI starts.

#### **Key Differences**:

- **Functionality**:
  - `ai-agent` handles backend processing, including AI tasks, database interactions, and API integrations.
  - `ai-agent-ui` handles the frontend, providing a user interface for interacting with the `ai-agent`.

- **Image**:
  - `ai-agent` uses an image tailored for backend operations.
  - `ai-agent-ui` uses an image designed to serve the web-based frontend.

- **Ports**:
  - `ai-agent` does not expose any ports directly (in this configuration), meaning it may not interact with users or external requests.
  - `ai-agent-ui` exposes port `5000`, making it accessible via a web browser or other HTTP client.

- **Dependencies**:
  - `ai-agent` depends on services (`questdb`, `grafana`, and `vscode`) that provide supporting functionality like data storage, monitoring, and development tools.
  - `ai-agent-ui` only depends on the `ai-agent` service, ensuring the backend is available before the UI starts.

## Decoupled Development: Building AI Agent Containers for Distributed AI Infrastructures


You can develop the AI Agent container on the microserver without knowing the specific details of the AI application running on the GPU server. In a distributed system like the AI Agent Farm, each component can be developed and deployed independently, as long as they follow a standardized communication protocol.

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **API Specification**: Define a clear and standardized API specification for communication between the AI Agent container on the microserver and the AI application on the GPU server. The API specification should outline the endpoints, request formats, and response formats that the AI Agent should use to interact with the AI application.

2. **Independent Development**: You can develop the AI Agent container on the microserver separately from the AI application on the GPU server. As long as the AI Agent adheres to the API specification, it can be treated as a black box from the perspective of the AI application.

3. **Mocking and Testing**: During development, you can use mocking techniques to simulate the behavior of the AI Agent container without actually running it on the microserver. This allows the AI application developers to test their code against the expected responses from the AI Agent.

4. **Integration Testing**: Once the AI Agent container is deployed on the microserver, you can perform integration testing to ensure that it communicates correctly with the AI application on the GPU server. This can be done by running both the AI Agent and the AI application in a controlled environment.

By following these steps, you can achieve a decoupled and modular architecture, where the AI Agent container can be developed independently and integrated seamlessly with the AI application on the GPU server. This approach allows for flexibility and ease of development, as well as scalability and fault tolerance in the AI Agent Farm infrastructure.
